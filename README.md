# NavMesh-Research-GPP
Gameplay programming research topic

I will try to create a system where a player character can build walls, updating the navmesh that the AI uses to navigate the world.

I will expand upon the A* pathfinding project, adding a new implementation of the Ear Clipping Algorithm which will update the navmesh if need be.
